# About Me

I'm a software development engineer working at Amazon Web Services, Vancouver. 

I solve problems in the Billing Insights domain. I've previously worked in functional domains like ERP and Advertising.

My research interests include statistical learning and its applications to Natural Language Processing, and my graduate research was supervised by [Dr. Olga Vechtomova](http://ov-research.uwaterloo.ca/).

## Recent Projects

### Disentangled Representation Learning for Non-Parallel Text Style Transfer

* **_Description:_** This paper tackles the problem of disentangling the latent representations of style and content in language models.  This disentangled latent representation learning can be applied to style transfer on non-parallel corpora.
* **_Stack:_** Tensorflow, NLTK
* **_Publication:_** [ACL 2019](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1041/)
* **_Source Code:_** [Github](https://github.com/vineetjohn/linguistic-style-transfer)

### Questrade: Capital Gains Compute

* **_Description:_** Personal utility to compute capital gains in Questrade investment accounts.
* **_Stack:_** Clojure, Questrade API
* **_Source Code:_** [Github](https://github.com/vineetjohn/clojure-questrade)


### Alexa Skill: Organization Social-Sentiment Aggregator

* **_Description:_** Alexa skill that aggregates public tweets in a user-defined time period, analyzes and reports the corresponding sentiment to users.
* **_Stack:_** AWS Lambda, NLTK, Vader, Alexa Skills Kit, Python-Twitter
* **_Source Code:_** [Github](https://github.com/v1n337/organization-sentiment-skill)

### Research Notes

* **_Description:_** My curated list of research papers along with a high-level overview of each paper's objectives, methods and results, in addition to my observations and comments. Most, if not all the papers, constitute important research in the field of Natural Language Processing / Computational Linguistics.
* **_Stack:_** LaTeX
